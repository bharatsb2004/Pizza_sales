# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL

This project presents an in-depth analysis of a fictional pizza sales database using SQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from sales data that can help a business understand customer preferences, revenue trends, and product performance.

## üìÇ Project Overview
The analysis is performed on a relational database named pizzaah which simulates a real-world pizza restaurant's sales data. It includes multiple levels of SQL queries (Easy, Medium, Hard) to solve different business questions, from basic aggregations to advanced window functions and revenue breakdowns.

## üß± Database Schema
The project involves three main tables:

### 1. orders :
   
Column	Data Type	Description,

order_id	INT	Unique ID for each order, 

order_date	DATE	Date when the order was placed, 

order_time	TIME	Time when the order was placed.

### 2. order_details :
   
Column	Data Type	Description,

order_details_id	INT	Unique ID for each order detail entry, 

order_id	INT	Foreign key referencing orders table, 

pizza_id	TEXT	ID of the pizza ordered, 

quantity	INT	Number of pizzas ordered.

### 3. pizzas :
   
Column	Data Type	Description,

pizza_id	TEXT	Unique ID of the pizza, 

pizza_type_id	TEXT	Foreign key referencing pizza_types table, 

size	TEXT	Size of the pizza (S, M, L, XL), 

price	FLOAT	Price of the pizza.

### 4. pizza_types :

Column	Data Type	Description,

pizza_type_id	TEXT	Unique type ID, 

name	TEXT	Name of the pizza, 

category	TEXT	Category (Classic, Veggie, etc.).

## üß† Key Analytical Methods Used
Joins: To combine relevant data from multiple tables.

Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG() for totals, averages, etc.

Grouping: GROUP BY to analyze by category, size, hour, etc.

Sorting and Ranking: ORDER BY, LIMIT, RANK() for top performers.

Window Functions: For cumulative revenue analysis and category-wise ranking.

Subqueries and CTEs: For modular and layered querying.

Data Transformation: Calculating percentage contributions and averages.
